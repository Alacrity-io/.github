# Alacrity 

## What is it about?
Alacrity is a decentralized p2p trading platform ; that enables two ‚Äúnon-trusting‚Äù parties to do commerce with each other(exchange goods and services) without having to establish trust via regular advance payments or legal contracts / legal authorities.
It specifically targets the trade of high value assets such as vehicles and real estate, where such fraud is quite common.
Using Asset Swap the buyer and the seller can rest assured that neither party can be defrauded and either of them can choose to walk away without harming the other.

## How does it Work?
To read about the system design of Alacrity and getting familiar with its tech-stack; i suggest reading my blog here:

For starters;
Alacrity has a microservices based architecture which can be illustrated by this figure
